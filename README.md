## This repo is used for having fun solving random problems in Python.

## As of now, the Checkbook notebookes are incomplete.

## The 'practice_python' notebook has some sample questions from different sources that are solved.

## The 'probability_in_python' notebook has some cool stuff. There are some probability with dice questions asked.  Additionally, there's a simulation of 1 million card decks to serve as a proxy to answer a probability question.
